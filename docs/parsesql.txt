There is a built-in sql parser which understands most SQL statements (but not
all of them).  This is in bondsql/ directory.

db_create("sql select or tablename"); will create a new dbobject. this has to
be parsed and modified to make sure its correct.  pg_oid needs to be added.
Likewise, * statements needs to be expanded out into there table and field
values.  The database structure needs to be queried to make sure the table
and field names are correctly found.  

Joins need to be understood and there information stored.  A pg_oid for each
table requested needs to be present.
