bonddb

bonddb is an object-oriented wrapper around SQL. It is designed to be fast
and simple data abstration layer to use.  You can get the speed and 
stablitiy of SQL while still having persistent objects and easy class 
management.

At the moment bonddb supports postgresql and gives you a C API.  
Integration with gnome-db is planned as the short term feature to give
greater database support.  Also more langauge interfaces are planned
in the future.

bonddb orginated from the bond project, visit http://bond.treshna.com
for more information.  The documentation here is not as complete as it is in
bond, as I'm still in the process of moving files over.
