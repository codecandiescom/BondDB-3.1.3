  How i suppose to delete rows now?

  the whole thing...
  

* Fix oid references to be table.field

* Hash tables on commonily used arrays




* Remove and put in any code with the #ifdef __PORTED around it.  There can
be comments of missing components, or design change swhich has problems. 

* remove all gtk and bond test code from dbtest, restart the testing process
and checking.  Rewrite the inital tests to check themselves instead of just
printing the values only.  Ie it knows when it doesn't work and prints error
message.  Add template database .sql file into cvs and test directory with
documentation on how to install it

* Common data sources, so if you modify one field it knows to update other
objects.  db_birth_effect needs to be finished off and the dbbuecrate
needs to call this 

* change function names to be db_filename_function ie db_field_add.  Some
modules like dbgather still dont support it.  functions in the api just have
db_function name, so things like dbclient can remain the same.  

* methods, add support for methods.  you could attach a method to a field in
a table and whenever that field is accessed it runs the function instead.
could start with just C pointer to function support then move to a seperate
libary, and then add python, slag etc method support where you impliment
from another lanagauge.  Lots of fun stuff.

* dbobjects, write code to extract first table name for updation from sql
statment. will have to use sql.c code to get this.  This is put in obj->name

* tidy up some of dbbirth sql functions by using the sql parser

* remove warnings from the code, theres annoying ones with that bizare error
messsage. not sure what happening there. either is baz and whoever else whos
looked at it.

* Add missing documentation to code

* remove non-needed attributes from Object

* finish of dbobjectvalid

* add more documentation, like a document detailing what each .c file does

* add in section information for web documents, and fill in documentation
for all files.

* Add gnome-db support

* Client/server knowledge of locking/shared access. This is a tricky large
section, in the bond.conf file you could specify a locking/shared access
database, this addtional database bonddb could create and then write into a
table all the changes that happen which the buecurate and log pick up on and
deal with.

* move dbwrapper code in regard to specific databases outside into seperate
libaries which are loaded at runtime and not at link time.

* free up memory.  Yes i know its annoying, but hey someones got to do it.
things like birth etc need to be freed by calling there proper calls

* test for memory leaks and destroy them

* strange stuff with sql in postgresql. table.field dont work so things like
db_id_verifysql will have to be modified. I fixed db_birth_createsql but the
other sql functions still need fixing.  db_id_createsql maybe a dieing
cause, may ditch function.  verifysql_other needs to check if the primary
keys are picked up by the * value and then not show them. hmmm

* hash tables in bureacrat to store sql statements and the fields they
depreived from as well as maybe base table.

* In db_verify_sql, if it has more than one table then do a table.field
instead of a just straight field.  This will effect oid somehow. hmmm.

* dbunieid.c, db_id_adduniqueid.  this needs some tidy up and linking to the
sql parser.  At the moment it only works on sane sql statements, it will
fall over on some insane sql.

* make idindexpos a different name. its so screwing up stuff cause thats
just cost me many hours. idindexpos is in dbobject.h

* Code iseffected function in dbbirth

* Fixed all documentationa errors and warnings, a file in docs/ describes
all the problems that have occured

* Tests 10 and 13 fail. Deletion of records doesn't work and searching
doesn't work properly. the lexer paser is the problem because it doesnt'
understand commands like LIKE and % marks, andre will have to expand this
