' example prototypes for calling these functions from VB '
'
' remove the 'K:' bit for production, but for debugging it may be handy to 
' map the K: drive of the host to the output directory of of the DLL
' see 1st_RUNME.bat for an example.
'
' in addition to this DLL you'll also need the bonddb, pgsql, glib DLLS.
' if one is missing VB gives a cryptic file not found error.
