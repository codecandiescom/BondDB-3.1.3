==========================================================================

Setting Up:
----------

In order to make and install this library you need postgresql development
files and glib installed on your system.  Make sure you have postgresql
version 7.3 or higher and glib1.2 or higher installed if you run into
problems.

To compile bonddb you need scons installed. Scons is a Makefile
replacement. Make compatibility has been left in. 
Type the following to build the source code.  
   scons
   scons install (NOTE: must be root user to perform this install) 

The dbtest programme requires a sample database set up on your system.
It will use this database to test itself and functionality.  

General Notes:

Please check the docs directory, website and reference directory for
more information on using bonddb.  db.h is the main api file which you
should include in your source code.  It can be quicker to look up the
functions in the db.c and db.h file as a quick reference on the api calls.

The library currently has high debugging on and told to get the hell out of
there if it thinks anything is slightly wrong.  This will mean your get a
lot of assertion failures when you first start playing, don't worry about it.
In time when i believe this to be really stable a lot of the assertions will
be made warnings. At the moment if data is missing from the database, or a 
form references a field that doesn't exist, or a 101 other minor things 
happen when you first create your fields bond calls an g_assert(NULL); 

NOTE:Unless the following  packages are installed, bond will not work:
	   - flex
	   - bison	    
	   - libtool
	   - postgresql-dev
	   - libglib2.0


Libgda installation
-------------------

(libgda is NOT required if you use direct connection to PostgreSQL).

Bonddb uses libgda version 1.3. For debian sarge users, you'll have to
install from source or cvs. It can be quite a mission to get it working, if
you get errors like GdaColumn not found etc when compiling it means your
using a version which is too old. This GNOME Data Abstraction layer can be
downloaded from http://www.gnome-db.org/

Gotcha's
---------------------

when installing.

this:

  $ su root scons install

may not work...

this:

  $ su root
  password:
  # scons install 

should work.

To install the libraries, /etc/ld.so.conf may need editing. Ensure that
/usr/local/lib is listed, adding it if not, then run ldconfig.

Sometimes bonddb2.pc does not install into the right location. This defaults
to /usr/lib/pkgconfig.  But can be overridden with the PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable before you compile and install bonddb.
ie.
  
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH = /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
  scons install


to build for windows 
------------------------

install 
  mingw32
  cross-tools    from svn.treshna.com/pub/cross-tools/trunk
  gtk-devel      etc for windows into /usr/i586-mingw32/usr/
  libpq          etc...
  
run 
  cross-scons
  su root
  cross-scons install 
  
  (which copies libs etc to /usr/i586-mingw32/usr/local/...)
  
Testing if you installed bonddb ok.
--------------------------------------

This should tell you the version of bonddb you have installed :

pkg-config bonddb2 --modversion

To test bonddb works fine run these commands :

createdb testbond
psql -f createtestdb.sql testbond
cd bonddb
./bonddbtest
